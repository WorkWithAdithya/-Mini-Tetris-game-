<h3>Aim: </h3>
<p>The aim of MiniTetris is to match as many colour-blocks as possible and not let the 
stack of blocks reach the top. When that happens, the game is over and all the blocks 
turn to white colour indicating that the game is over</p>

<h3>Controls: </h3>
<p>The controls of the game are simple, use the right/left arrow keys to move the colour 
block in the horizontal direction. Use the down arrow key to increase the speed at 
which the block falls down. Press the “Home” key to restart the game.</p>

<h3>Scoring: </h3>
<p>
The total score at the end is the total number of same colour blocks that the user has 
connected throughout the game.  </p>
