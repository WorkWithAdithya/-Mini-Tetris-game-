<h1>  Mini-Tetris-game</h1>

<h2>About the game </h2>
<p>In the game, what the user has to do to earn points, is to match the blocks falling 
down with the same colour blocks. The user can match the blocks in either vertical or 
horizontal direction (or both). This will result in those blocks disappearing and the user will 
get points. The blocks that are falling down are of random colour and at a random position on 
the horizontal line. To make things even more interesting, the speed at which the blocks fall 
down increases gradually as the game progresses.</p>

<h3>Aim: </h3>
<p>The aim of MiniTetris is to match as many colour-blocks as possible and not let the 
stack of blocks reach the top. When that happens, the game is over and all the blocks 
turn to white colour indicating that the game is over</p>

<h3>Controls: </h3>
<p>The controls of the game are simple, use the right/left arrow keys to move the colour 
block in the horizontal direction. Use the down arrow key to increase the speed at 
which the block falls down. Press the “Home” key to restart the game.</p>
